# Hugo Docker

This is a short Dockerfile to build and run Hugo inside a Docker container.

To use it, simply `clone` this repository, run `./build.sh`, and then `./run.sh path/to/your/hugo/site/`.

I wrote a blog post about this; you can check it out on [mooremachine.github.io/posts/how-to-start-a-blog/](https://mooremachine.github.io/posts/how-to-start-a-blog/).
